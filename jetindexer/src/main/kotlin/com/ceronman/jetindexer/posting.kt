/**
 * Represents a list of postings for a given token.
 *
 * An inverted index maps a token to a posting list. The posting lists contains
 * the document IDs that have the token and the positions of that token in the files.
 * This is the heart of the inverted index.
 *
 * To be memory efficient, this stores the posting list in a compressed form inside a
 * [ByteBuffer].
 *
 * (document id)(number of positions)(pos 1)(pos 2)...(pos n)(doc id)...
 *
 * The integers representing the document ids, number of positions and positions are encoded
 * in a variable byte encoding (aka VarInt) (@see [ByteBuffer.putVarInt]) to save space.
 *
 * To increase efficiency, the positions are stored as deltas. So for example of for a given
 * file the list of positions [1 7 20]. These are stored as [1, 6, 14]. Smaller integers allow
 * for better compression.
 *
 * The order of the posting list is very important. File IDs should be stored in a monotonically
 * increasing way. Same for file positions.
