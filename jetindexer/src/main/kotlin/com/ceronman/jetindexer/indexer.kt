/**
 * JetIndexer is a text search engine library.
 *
 * JetIndexer takes a list of directories and it indexes text files contained in those
 * recursively. Additionally, it can watch those directories for changes and update
 * the index accordingly. Once the index is built it is possible to search text
 * in the indexed files in a fast way.
 *
 * The indexation process can be customized by providing a custom [Tokenizer] and or
 * [QueryResolver]. Filtering which files should be indexed can be configured by
 * providing a [IndexingFilter] object.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ```
 * val path = Paths.get("/path/to/files")
 * val indexer = JetIndexer(listOf(path))
 * indexer.index()
 * indexer.query("foo")
 * ```
 *
 * @param paths A collection of [Path] objects containing the documents to index.
 * @param tokenizer A [Tokenizer] object to split the documents in tokens to index.
 *  By default it uses a [WhiteSpaceTokenizer]
 * @param queryResolver A [QueryResolver] for advanced search capabilities. By
 *  default it uses a [StandardQueryResolver]
 * @param indexingFilter A [IndexingFilter] object to restrict what kinds of files
 *  should be indexes and which ones shouldn't. By default it uses a [DefaultIndexingFilter]
