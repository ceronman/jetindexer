Caveats of the implementation:

- Only UTF-8 file encoding is handled at the moment. Files in different encodings will cause errors.
- All files in the given paths are processed, there is no way to skip certain kinds of files.
  It would be nice to add an option to filter certain extensions or file patterns e.g. `.git`
- Errors while reading files are logged and ignored, no exception is raised. This is a design choice.
  It would be nice to make the library be able to programmatically query the errors that have occurred
  while indexed.
- It would be nice to have a way of checking progress when indexing.
- There is currently no limit to the depth of the file scanning. Alghouth symbolic links are followed.
