Caveats of the implementation:

- Only UTF-8 file encoding is handled at the moment. Files in different encodings will cause errors.
- Errors while reading files are logged and ignored, no exception is raised. This is a design choice.
  It would be nice to make the library be able to programmatically query the errors that have occurred
  while indexed.
